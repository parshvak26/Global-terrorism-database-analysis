Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Global Terrorism Database
Overview
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). The GTD is one of the most comprehensive datasets on terrorist incidents worldwide, containing information on various attributes, including location, date, attack type, target type, and casualty details. EDA aims to gain insights and understand patterns in global terrorism incidents, facilitating informed decision-making and preventive measures.

Dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) provides a vast collection of terrorism-related events spanning multiple decades. The dataset encompasses records of terrorist attacks from different regions and terrorist organizations, enabling in-depth analysis and visualization.

Techniques Used
The EDA on the Global Terrorism Database entails a combination of data exploration and visualization techniques, including:

Data Cleaning
The dataset may contain missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies that need to be addressed before analysis. Data cleaning ensures that the information is accurate and reliable for further investigation.

Data Visualization
Visualizing the data through various plots and charts (e.g., bar charts, histograms, geographical maps) helps to identify trends, patterns, and hotspots of terrorist incidents across different time periods and locations.

Temporal Analysis
Analyzing the time-based patterns of terrorist attacks, such as yearly trends, seasonal variations, and long-term patterns, can provide valuable insights into the evolving nature of global terrorism.

Geographic Analysis
Mapping the geographical distribution of terrorist incidents can reveal high-risk areas and regions prone to attacks, assisting in understanding the geopolitical aspects of terrorism.

Target and Attack Type Analysis
Investigating the target types (e.g., government, civilians, military) and attack methods (e.g., bombing, kidnapping, assassination) can shed light on the motives and tactics of terrorist organizations.

How to Use
Obtain the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) from the authoritative source or an open data repository.
Clone this repository to your local machine and set up the required libraries and dependencies (specified in requirements.txt).
Run the data_preprocessing.py script to clean and prepare the GTD for analysis.
Utilize the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided to perform EDA and generate insightful visualizations.
Draw conclusions and actionable insights from the EDA results.
Contributions
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have novel ideas for visualizations or additional analyses, your contributions can enhance the understanding of global terrorism incidents.
